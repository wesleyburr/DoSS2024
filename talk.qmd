* Who am I?
* Air Pollution: the Case for Human Impact
* Interesting Problems 

## Who Am I?

* PhD from Queen's University in statistics, under David J. Thomson
* most definitely an applied statistician
* joined Trent University in 2016, became Chair of Math & Stats in 2022
* do a lot of random things that are all connected through the lens of "interesting data",
with a theme of time series

## Air Pollution?

As I mentioned in the abstract for the talk, today I'd like
to talk about a series of connected problems in applied statistics,
all stemming from the question:

<br>

> Given broad population-level measurements of air pollution and climate,
> and aggregate population-level health counts, what can we estimate
> about the acute impacts of air pollution exposure on human health?

## Air Pollution Exposure

First, a little history lesson. Why do we think air pollution 
would impact human health at all? 

<br>

> This may seem obvious, but obvious things are tricky!

## Coal Miners

* Black Lung Disease
* long-term exposure to coal dust
* similar to silicosis and asbestosis

---

## Great Smog of London (1952)
