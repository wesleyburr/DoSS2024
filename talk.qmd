* Who am I?
* Air Pollution: the Case for Human Impact
* Interesting Problems 

## Who Am I?

* PhD from Queen's University in statistics (2012), under David J. Thomson
* joined Trent University in 2016, became Chair of Math & Stats in 2022
* do a lot of random things that are all connected through the lens of "interesting data",
with a theme of time series and statistical signal processing

## Air Pollution?

As I mentioned in the abstract for the talk, today I'd like
to talk about a series of connected problems in applied statistics,
all stemming from the question:

<br>

> Given broad population-level measurements of air pollution and climate,
> and aggregate population-level health counts, what can we estimate
> about the acute impacts of air pollution exposure on human health?

## Air Pollution Exposure

First, a little history lesson. Why do we think air pollution 
would impact human health at all? 

<br>

## Growing Evidence

The past two are extreme examples. Weight of evidence grew across the 20th
century, including through increased research into the long-term impacts
of tobacco smoking. 

<br>

> Acute exposure to very, very high levels of air pollution is bad. 
> Chronic exposure to high levels of air pollution is bad. 

<br>

**Toxicology-Style Question**: what is the safe dose?

## A Question of Measurement

We're statisticians. 

<br>

Our first instinct when faced with a problem is to **gather data**.

<br>

(or design a study ... to gather data).

<br>

What data makes sense to try to measure the dose-response of exposure to 
air pollution?

## Questions to Answer

* what, exactly, do we mean by "acute"?
* what is the unit of study?
* what is the dose, and how is it measured?
* ... can we do this outside of controlled (chamber) studies?

> These lead us to ecological studies: it's just too expensive to do anything else.

* population level "health" metric
* population level "exposure" metric
* whack them in a model, hope you're measuring something meaningful and
matching your definition of "acute"


## First Major Unified Result

There was a **lot** of research done by really good statisticians in the 1980s
and 1990s on these questions. The first unified result that set a standard
for the field came out of Francesca Dominici's postdoctoral work at 
Hopkins from 1998-2000:

</center>

## What Did This Paper Provide?

* population-level average exposures using a network of ground-source monitors
* population-level counts of health outcomes (e.g., deaths due to ICD-10 J-causes - pulmonary)
* the use of GAMs to measure association
* the use of Bayesian partial pooling to produce regional and national estimates
* some time series influences - especially suggestion that what was being done fit under the definition of filters

## Let's Start Here

This is the launching-off point where I largely got involved in this field. 

There
**were** another half dozen fundamental papers between 2000 and 2010, mostly concerned
with expanding this framework, and fine-tuning the model to prevent 
multicollinearity^[Shout out to Tim Ramsay's 2003 [paper](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2003/01000/the_effect_of_concurvity_in_generalized_additive.9.aspx) which firmed things up nicely.], but this is the framework I started working with in graduate school.

# Filters

##  What is a Filter, Exactly?
One of the questions I first considered was this idea (from Dominici, Samet, Zeger, Peng, etc.) 
that including cubic regression splines in a GAM could be considered a **filter**.

* I thought I knew what a filter is (from the spectrum estimation point of view)
* This is an odd definition of a filter
* So what is it doing?

## Turns Out ...

... if you think of these fixed basis splines as a filter, they **are** ... but
a very poor one!

> We can do better. 

Apply the last 30 years of spectrum estimation theory, use optimal basis functions
(prolate spheroidal sequences), sprinkle in a smidge of multitaper spectrum 
estimation inspiration and ...

# Natural Experiments

## Take the Framework, Apply it to One-Off Events

You know the saying: once you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Can we take this framework and way of thinking about air pollution exposure,
and expand it further by considering it as a tool for exploring natural experiments?

(rhetorical question)

## Oil Refineries

* Oil refineries are known as fairly stinky sites. 
* While controlled, there's a **lot** of particulate matter and volatile organics
that are emitted in the process of cracking oil to make gasoline and byproducts
* If we use the earlier framework, can we look at the "before" and "after" of a 
plant closure - as a natural experiment, what effects are observable?

# What's With Lag?

## The Question of Lag

When building models in this framework, one of the most common things to do
is to *lag* the predictors. Why?

* justified via biological mechanism delay
* gives higher associations

However ... it feels very *ad hoc*.

## Phase As Lag

Coming at this problem from a time series point of view^[As compared to a more structural point of view, e.g., Gasparrini, Armstrong & Kenward, 2010.], 
lagging the  predictors is somehow trying to align the stuctured of the model with the autocovariance inherent in the data.

* but the filters are supposed to be removing the long timescale structure
* supposedly the autocorrelation function is near zero^[It's not really.]
* what exactly is driving the association?

# Transfer Function Models

## Rewriting the Book

Everything mentioned so far fits into the framework regularized by
Dominici et al. between 1998 and 2006. Why?

* it's what the field uses, and change is hard
* it works^[To some extent ... ]

But can we do better if we rethink the entire modeling paradigm? 

## What is the question again?

Given a restriction of ecological data^[Personalized exposures would be lovely, but are just not feasible ... yet. Some work is being done on this.], what do we
have?

* daily counts of some health outcome^[Daily, otherwise we just don't have enough data to be measured.]
* corresponding daily exposure proxies
* corresponding daily covariates

And the question?

> Given broad population-level measurements of air pollution and climate,
> and aggregate population-level health counts, what can we estimate
> about the acute impacts of air pollution exposure on human health?

## Transfer Function Models

As you might have gathered from these examples, I often look at problems
through the lens of a frequency-domain representation. So:

* an *association* is a measurement of relationship between
two time series: a predictor^[The problem of two or more pollutants is a thorny one, and a completely open problem.] and a response.
* why should that association be linear?
* obviously the lags matter

In the applied fields of oceanography, magnetotellurics, and helioseismology,
spectra are often used and the **map** between them is the objective function.
These functions **transfer** power from one to the other, so ... **transfer function models**.

## Current Research

This is a currently open research project with Glen Takahara (Queen's),
David Riegert (Trent & Queen's), and Hwashin H. Shin (Health Canada).

* the estimation of the transfer functions has been solved - robustly, at that!
* the interpretation is proving ... difficult^[We can come up with lots of options for measurements. So far, none of them are directly comparable to the past methods. This is annoying.]

# Honourable Mention

## Source Apportionment

Project led by Marta Blangiardo and Monica Pirani.

# Conclusions

## Applied Problems can be Fun

* I enjoy applied problems. 
* I enjoy developing methods and algorithms for
practitioners. 
* This question of air pollution and health that I first
considered in 2010 has proved to be a rich vein to mine, over and over,
with some pretty fun methodologies and algorithms along the way

## Open Problems

* personalized exposure
* better (spatiotemporal) modeling of exposure at a population level^[Patrick Brown and Marta Blangiardo have both independently led some really interesting work connected to this.]
* change your source measurements: data fusion
* the question of pooling and aggregation of risk
* extreme events as "acute"
* can we use machine learning models in an effective way to do any of this?
* multiple pollutants^[The Holy Grail. Really, really hard.] simultaneously
