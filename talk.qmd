* Who am I?
* Air Pollution: the Case for Human Impact
* Interesting Problems 

## Who Am I?

* PhD from Queen's University in statistics, under David J. Thomson
* most definitely an applied statistician
* joined Trent University in 2016, became Chair of Math & Stats in 2022
* do a lot of random things that are all connected through the lens of "interesting data",
with a theme of time series

## Air Pollution?

As I mentioned in the abstract for the talk, today I'd like
to talk about a series of connected problems in applied statistics,
all stemming from the question:

<br>

> Given broad population-level measurements of air pollution and climate,
> and aggregate population-level health counts, what can we estimate
> about the acute impacts of air pollution exposure on human health?

## Air Pollution Exposure

First, a little history lesson. Why do we think air pollution 
would impact human health at all? 

<br>

> This may seem obvious, but obvious things are tricky!

## Coal Miners

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
* Black Lung Disease
* long-term exposure to coal dust
* similar to silicosis and asbestosis
* tens of thousands of deaths, but very delayed
* **chronic exposure**

## Great Smog of London (1952)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
* temperature inversion: high-pressure system and cold weather
* trapped all of the heavy pollution from coal burning and diesel vehicles
* incredibly thick smog
* thousands of deaths
* **acute exposure**

## Growing Evidence

The past two are extreme examples. Weight of evidence grew across the 20th
century, including through the increased research into the long-term impacts
of tobacco smoking. 

<br>

> Acute exposure to very, very high levels of air pollution is bad. 
> Chronic exposure to high levels of air pollution is bad. 

<br>

**Toxicology-Style Question**: what is the safe dose?

## A Question of Measurement

We're statisticians. 

<br>

Our first instinct when faced with a problem is to **gather data**.

<br>

(or design a study ... to gather data).

<br>

What data makes sense to try to measure the dose-response of exposure to 
air pollution?

---

## Questions to Answer

* what is the unit of study?
* what is the dose, and how is it measured?
* ... can we do this outside of controlled (chamber) studies?
