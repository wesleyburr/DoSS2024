## A Brief History

* magnetic fields are generated by moving electric particles
* the Earth has a magnetic field
* this field varies across the surface and sub-surface and atmosphere of
the Earth
* observations of the magnetic field are useful for all sorts of 
physical science applications

## In Canada

* original magnetic observatory was in Toronto, founded in 1840
* the electrification of the Toronto tramway system resulted in interference,
and the observatory was moved to Agincourt in 1897
* the Agincourt Observatory was in continuous operation from 1898 to 1969,
but had to be closed due to industrial development and highway construction
* the Ottawa observatory (south of Ottawa, near Mer Bleue) was opened in July 1968, and has been in continuous operation since
* ... may need to be moved soon, as the O-Train extension is starting to inch closer and closer!

## What Kind of Data is this?

Time series!

- The fluxgate magnetometer samples the magnetic field at 8 Hz
- Three component data streams
- Filtered, resampled at 1 Hz
- Further filtered and resampled at 0.2 Hz (5 seconds)
- Finally, filtered and resampled to 1 minute intervals

The four 1-minute data streams are passed to the transmitter to be relayed in bursts at 12 minute intervals via a GOES satellite to various data nodes.
